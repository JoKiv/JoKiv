# Greetings

I'm currently living in Kemi, Finland, EU

Pronouns: he/him/h√§n

## What do I do for fun and creativity

I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jokiv) and [Kick](https://kick.com/jokiv). I upload videos to a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@jokiv).

I usually chat with people on [Discord](https://discord.gg/N5wbdnU) and there I'll stream additional content.

Video editing with [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) for simple edits and [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) for bigger projects.  

I primarily use [Python](https://www.python.org/) for programming, but I also use [godot/gdscript](https://godotengine.org/), [node-red/javascript](https://nodered.org/), [PureBasic](https://purebasic.com) and [Vision Basic](https://visionbasic.net/). I'm also interested [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [TRSE](https://turborascal.com). 

My projects are [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) compatible. 

I rarely but still mainly release my stuff via [jokiv.itch.io](https://jokiv.itch.io/).

I have blog at [jokiv.fi](https://jokiv.fi/). Some small updates can be seen also at my [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jokiv) page.

## Frequently Tinkered Topics

[Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/). My multi tool.

Commodore 64 programming - old and new, with a mix of vintage and modern tools.

I'm slowly writing a book. No promises on when or if it'll be out.

## Apple stuff

I have recently gained more familiarity with Apple's ecosystem, and it remains to be seen how this new knowledge may influence my future projects. No promises.

## New stuff since last update

I have resumed my C64 projects.
