# Greetings

I live at Kemi, Finland, EU

I'm currently working via light entrepreneurship while looking for a job.

Pronouns: he/him/h√§n

## What do I do for fun and creativity

I stream on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/jokiv) and [Kick](https://kick.com/jokiv).

I upload videos to a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@jokiv).

I usually chat with people on [Discord](https://discord.gg/N5wbdnU) and there I'll stream additional content.

Video editing with [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/en/) for simple edits and [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/) for bigger projects. I can do basic editing with some effects. Since I resumed youtube uploads I have been getting better at it. 

I primarily use [Python](https://www.python.org/) for programming, but I also use [godot/gdscript](https://godotengine.org/), [node-red/javascript](https://nodered.org/) and [PureBasic](https://purebasic.com). I'm also interested [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [TRSE](https://turborascal.com).

My projects are [Steam Deck](https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck) compatible when possible.

I mainly release my stuff via [jokiv.itch.io](https://jokiv.itch.io/). I have additional plans for the future.

I have blog at [jokiv.fi](https://jokiv.fi/). Some small updates can be seen also at my [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/jokiv) page.
